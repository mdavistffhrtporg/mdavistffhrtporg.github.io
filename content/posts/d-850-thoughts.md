I'm trying to find photographs that I haven't posted before as a part of my content. On my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mattdmattphoto), I put that I was considering trying to sell my Nikon D850, a camera that I consider one of the best ever made. Well, I've changed my mind. I'm going to keep it. At least for hobby photography. I'm still going to get rid of much of my professional gear that I do not use, such as my bigger, heavier lenses, etc.

But, I just can't part with my D850. It has become my favorite camera, and I absolutely love the photographs that is produces, the colors it captures, and everything about it. Hopefully I can pass it down to my daughter one day, and she'll be able to enjoy it just as much as I do!

Oh, and, here's an amazing photograph that wasn't produced with my D850...
