Hi,

**Matt** is a professional photographer and open source software contributor. He enjoys using his Oklahoma Joes offset smoker in his free time, and sitting outside on hot summer nights smoking brisket and pork butts. He actively contributes to the [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/), a part of the [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/), as a writer and editor. He has been in the world of open source software since 2003, and has used Fedora Linux since it was known as Fedora Core 1.

In August 2006, he began his studies at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), majoring in Psychology. At the university, he conducted research in neuroscience, specifically specializing in electrophysiology and pain. While conducting research, he obtained several publications. He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 2010. In May 2016, he began studying for his Master of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/), and graduated in 2019.

Currently, he is a writer and editor for the Fedora Project's Fedora Magazine. By using open source software, his goal is to learn from that software, and spread the word about the freedoms that come with it. He is a big time computer enthusiast, with a background in Information Technology, and Cybersecurity.
